# Gamified-Programming-ELearning-Tool
(2024) An application developed for my thesis titled: "**Improving learning to program for noncomputer science undergraduates by creating a gamified application**".

This includes two sets of levels where the user creates programs using a train-track-based language and a pseudocode-like language to solve puzzles, in order to introduce programming language constructs and ease the transition to real languages.

The thesis report is included in the project as `Final Report.pdf`

## Technologies/Techniques Used:
- Parsing and evaluation of custom programming language
- Multiple testing types used: unit, partition (including automatic unit tests), and integration testing
- Thorough and detailed literature review completed on relevant and recent academic literature
- Year-long project planning using the agile methodology

## Features:
- Custom pseudocode-like language and accompanying parser and evaluator built from scratch
- Custom abstract rail-based language and accompanying evaluator implemented using trees and nodes
- Syntax and type checking give detailed custom error messages, with error locations
- User data saving and loading
- User personalisation
- Custom levels
- Sandbox mode
- Constructs supported by the pseudocode-like language interpreter:
  - If/else conditionals
  - For and While loops
  - Arithmetic, comparative, and boolean operators
  - Int, float, bool, string, and arrays
  - Random number generation
